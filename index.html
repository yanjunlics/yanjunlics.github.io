      <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
        Dr. Yanjun Li is a tenure-track Assistant Professor (AI Initiative) in the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at the College of Pharmacy, University of Florida.
          His research interests span the fields of deep learning, AI-driven drug discovery, and computational biology, with a particular emphasis on deep generative modeling for <i>de novo</i> molecule design and geometric deep learning for molecular recognition.
          Dr. Li’s work aims to develop innovative AI algorithms to tackle foundational life science challenges with broad scientific impacts and to optimize and automate real-world drug discovery and design pipelines.

        </p>
        Before joining the University of Florida, Dr. Li successively worked as a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute of Deep Learning, <a href="http://research.baidu.com/">Baidu Research USA</a>, Sunnyvale, California, and at
        <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com/">Calico Life Sciences</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.#:~:text=Executive%20Leader-,Calico,Arthur%20D.%20Levinson,-CapitalG">Alphabet-founded</a> research lab for human aging research.
        He received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Florida (2021),
        advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~dapengwu/">Dr. Dapeng Oliver Wu</a> and
        <a href="https://cognization.com/andyli/">Dr. Xiaolin (Andy) Li.</a>
        He received his dual M.E. from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and Waseda University (2015)
        and B.E. from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (2012).
